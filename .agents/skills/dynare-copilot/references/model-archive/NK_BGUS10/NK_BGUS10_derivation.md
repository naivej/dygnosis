## 1. Model Overview

- **Model**: MMB `NK_BGUS10`, the United States fluid-labor-market calibration of the Blanchard-Gali New Keynesian model with unemployment.
- **Purpose**: analyze productivity shocks and monetary policy trade-offs when price stickiness, labor-market hiring frictions, and real wage rigidity make unemployment inefficiently cyclical.
- **Agents and blocks**: a representative household, intermediate goods firms with hiring costs, monopolistically competitive final goods firms with Calvo pricing, and a monetary authority.
- **Form**: log-linear `model(linear)` system around a zero-inflation steady state. Lower-case hatted variables are log deviations except unemployment, which is a deviation from its steady-state rate.
- **Variant**: the MMB implementation uses the US/fluid labor-market calibration, with steady-state unemployment `u = 0.05` and job-finding rate `x = 0.7`.

## 2. Optimization Problems

### Representative Household

The household maximizes expected utility over consumption and employment:

```math
E_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t
\left(\log C_t - \chi \frac{N_t^{1+\phi}}{1+\phi}\right),
\qquad 0 \le N_t \le 1.
```

The log-linear Euler condition used in the MMB entry is the consumption FOC of this household.

### Labor-Market Flows and Hiring Costs

At the start of period `t`, the unemployment pool is

```math
U_t = 1 - (1-\delta)N_{t-1}.
```

Aggregate hires and labor-market tightness are

```math
H_t = N_t - (1-\delta)N_{t-1}, \qquad
x_t = \frac{H_t}{U_t}.
```

Hiring costs per hire are proportional to productivity and increasing in tightness:

```math
G_t = A_t B x_t^\alpha.
```

### Firms and Price Setting

Intermediate goods production is linear in employment:

```math
X_t(j) = A_t N_t(j).
```

The real marginal cost combines the wage component, current hiring costs, and the expected continuation value of lower future hiring costs:

```math
MC_t =
\Theta A_t^{-\gamma}
+ B x_t^\alpha
- \beta(1-\delta)E_t\left[
\frac{C_t}{C_{t+1}}\frac{A_{t+1}}{A_t}B x_{t+1}^\alpha
\right].
```

Final goods firms set prices under Calvo staggering. Log-linearization around a zero-inflation steady state gives the New Keynesian Phillips curve in Section 3.

### Monetary Authority

For the MMB `NK_BGUS10` entry, the policy rule is the optimized simple rule reported for the US calibration:

```math
i_t = \rho + \phi_\pi \pi_t + \phi_u \hat u_t,
```

with implementation cross-check values `phi_pi = 5` and `phi_u = -0.8`.

## 3. First-Order Conditions

The following linearized equilibrium conditions are the model equations used by the MMB US calibration. Equation (F2) follows the paper's equation (25); the OCR line break was normalized and should be checked against the PDF if this entry is promoted beyond first-pass status.

- **(F1) New Keynesian Phillips curve**:

```math
\pi_t = \beta E_t\{\pi_{t+1}\} + \lambda \widehat{mc}_t.
```

- **(F2) Real marginal cost under hiring costs and real wage rigidity** (`needs_review` OCR normalization):

```math
\widehat{mc}_t =
\alpha g\mathcal{M}\hat{x}_t
- \beta(1-\delta)g\mathcal{M}E_t\left[
(\hat{c}_t-\hat{a}_t)-(\hat{c}_{t+1}-\hat{a}_{t+1})+\alpha\hat{x}_{t+1}
\right]
- \Phi\gamma\hat{a}_t.
```

- **(F3) Flexible-price marginal-cost counterpart**:

```math
\alpha g\mathcal{M}\hat{x}^f_t =
\beta(1-\delta)g\mathcal{M}E_t\left[
(\hat{c}^f_t-\hat{a}_t)-(\hat{c}^f_{t+1}-\hat{a}_{t+1})+\alpha\hat{x}^f_{t+1}
\right]
+ \Phi\gamma\hat{a}_t.
```

- **(F4) Household Euler equation**:

```math
\hat{c}_t = E_t\{\hat{c}_{t+1}\} - \left(i_t - E_t\{\pi_{t+1}\} - \rho\right).
```

- **(F5) Flexible-price household Euler equation**:

```math
\hat{c}^f_t = E_t\{\hat{c}^f_{t+1}\} - (r_t-\rho).
```

## 4. Market Clearing & Identities

- **(F6) Labor-market tightness from employment dynamics**:

```math
\delta\hat{x}_t =
\hat{n}_t - (1-\delta)(1-x)\hat{n}_{t-1}.
```

- **(F7) Flexible-price tightness from employment dynamics**:

```math
\delta\hat{x}^f_t =
\hat{n}^f_t - (1-\delta)(1-x)\hat{n}^f_{t-1}.
```

- **(F8) Goods-market resource relation**:

```math
\hat{c}_t =
\hat{a}_t
+ \frac{1-g}{1-\delta g}\hat{n}_t
+ \frac{g(1-\delta)}{1-\delta g}\hat{n}_{t-1}
- \frac{\alpha g}{1-\delta g}\delta\hat{x}_t.
```

- **(F9) Flexible-price resource relation**:

```math
\hat{c}^f_t =
\hat{a}_t
+ \frac{1-g}{1-\delta g}\hat{n}^f_t
+ \frac{g(1-\delta)}{1-\delta g}\hat{n}^f_{t-1}
- \frac{\alpha g}{1-\delta g}\delta\hat{x}^f_t.
```

- **(F10) Optimized simple monetary policy rule, US calibration**:

```math
i_t = \rho + 5\pi_t - 0.8\hat{u}_t.
```

- **(F11) Unemployment deviation and employment**:

```math
\hat{u}_t = -(1-u)\hat{n}_t.
```

- **(F12) Flexible-price unemployment deviation and employment**:

```math
\hat{u}^f_t = -(1-u)\hat{n}^f_t.
```

- **(F13) Output identity**:

```math
\hat{y}_t = \hat{a}_t + \hat{n}_t.
```

- **(F14) Flexible-price output identity**:

```math
\hat{y}^f_t = \hat{a}_t + \hat{n}^f_t.
```

## 5. Exogenous Processes

- **(F15) Technology process**:

```math
\hat{a}_t = \rho_a\hat{a}_{t-1} + \varepsilon^a_t.
```

The MMB implementation writes the innovation with a negative sign, `a = ra*a(-1) - a_`; this sign convention is recorded as an implementation cross-check rather than a paper-side equation.

## 6. Steady-State Solution

Because the archived MMB entry is `model(linear)`, all endogenous model variables are expressed as deviations around steady state, so the steady state of the linear system is zero:

```math
\pi = \widehat{mc} = \hat{x} = \hat{c} = \hat{a} = \hat{n} = \hat{u} = i-\rho = 0,
```

and likewise for the flexible-price counterparts.

The nonzero calibration objects underlying those deviations are:

```math
\mathcal{M}=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon-1}, \qquad
\lambda=\frac{(1-\beta\theta)(1-\theta)}{\theta}, \qquad
\rho=-\log\beta.
```

For the US/fluid-labor-market calibration:

```math
u=0.05,\qquad x=0.7,\qquad
\delta=\frac{ux}{(1-u)(1-x)},\qquad
g=Bx^\alpha.
```

The paper chooses `B` so that steady-state hiring costs are about one percent of GDP under the US calibration, sets `gamma = 0.5`, `alpha = 1`, `beta = 0.99`, `phi = 1`, `epsilon = 6`, and uses the constrained-efficient condition to pin down `chi`.

## 7. Timing & Form Conventions

- **Form**: linearized model, implemented with Dynare `model(linear)`.
- **Expectations**: forward-looking terms in (F1)-(F5) are dated with `E_t`.
- **Employment timing**: employment `N_t` includes workers hired during period `t`; beginning-of-period unemployment depends on `N_{t-1}`.
- **Tightness timing**: `x_t` is the period-`t` job-finding rate, defined from hires during period `t` divided by the beginning-of-period unemployment pool.
- **Shock sign**: the paper-side technology law is written as a standard AR(1); the Rep-MMB file uses `a = ra*a(-1) - a_`, so impulse signs should be checked before runtime comparisons.
- **Runtime validation**: not performed.
