# US_FM95AL - Derivation

## 1. Model Overview

- **Model**: Fuhrer-Moore relative real contract-price model of U.S. inflation persistence.
- **Source mapping**: `raw/mmb_mineru/model_index.csv` maps `US_FM95AL` to the MinerU Markdown source `raw/mmb_mineru/runs/us_fm95_us_fm95al__inflation_persistence__c66e898c/full.md` with title-match score 1.0000.
- **Core mechanism**: staggered nominal contracts last four quarters. The aggregate log price level is a weighted average of outstanding contract prices. In the relative-contracting version, the current real contract price is set relative to overlapping real contract prices and expected excess demand.
- **Observable block**: the paper combines the contracting equations with reduced-form VAR equations for the output gap and the short bill rate so that expectations of excess demand are model-consistent.
- **Policy-use variant**: the paper's policy experiments add a nominal-output growth reaction function. The local MMB implementation cross-check instead wraps the contract block in a `model(linear)` policy-rule interface used by MMB optimal-control comparisons.
- **Form**: linear forward-looking model. The MMB file uses `model(linear)`. Variables are logs, rates, gaps, or auxiliary linear combinations, not nonlinear levels.

## 2. Optimization Problems

The paper does not provide a micro-founded household-firm optimization problem. It explicitly uses overlapping nominal contract-price equations motivated by wage bargaining. This archive therefore records the behavioral contract-setting problem rather than inventing omitted household or firm programs.

Contract setters choose the current nominal contract price $`x_t`$. The contract remains in effect for four quarters with weights $`f_i`$ on contracts negotiated in periods $`t-i`$, $`i=0,\ldots,3`$. In the relative version, setters compare real contract prices rather than nominal contract prices:

```math
x_t - p_t
\quad\text{is chosen relative to}\quad
E_t(v_{t+i}),\; i=0,\ldots,3,
\quad\text{and expected excess demand}\quad E_t(\tilde y_{t+i}).
```

The behavioral objective is summarized by the relative contract equation in Section 3. There is no separate resource constraint, production technology, or intertemporal Euler condition in the paper-side model.

## 3. First-Order Conditions

- **(F1) Aggregate price index from outstanding nominal contracts**:

```math
p_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i x_{t-i}.
```

- **(F2) Downward-sloping four-quarter contract distribution**:

```math
f_i = 0.25 + (1.5-i)s,\qquad 0 < s \leq \frac{1}{6},\qquad i=0,\ldots,3.
```

- **(F3) Contract weights sum to one**:

```math
\sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i = 1,\qquad f_i \geq 0.
```

- **(F4) Real contract-price index**:

```math
v_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i\bigl(x_{t-i}-p_{t-i}\bigr).
```

- **(F5) Relative real contract-price equation**:

```math
x_t - p_t =
\sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i E_t\bigl(v_{t+i}+\gamma \tilde y_{t+i}\bigr)
+ \epsilon^p_t.
```

- **(F6) Two-sided relative contracting representation**:

```math
x_t-p_t =
\sum_{i=1}^{3}\beta_i(x_{t-i}-p_{t-i})
+\sum_{i=1}^{3}\beta_iE_t(x_{t+i}-p_{t+i})
+\gamma^\ast\sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i E_t(\tilde y_{t+i})
+\epsilon^p_t.
```

- **(F7) Overlap coefficients in the two-sided representation**:

```math
\beta_i =
\frac{\sum_j f_j f_{i+j}}{1-\sum_j f_j^2},
\qquad
\gamma^\ast =
\frac{\gamma}{1-\sum_j f_j^2}.
```

- **(F8) Inflation definition**:

```math
\pi_t = p_t-p_{t-1}.
```

- **(F9) Contract-price inflation identity**:

```math
\theta_t = x_t-x_{t-1},\qquad \pi_t=f(L)\theta_t,\qquad \theta_t=f^{-1}(L)\pi_t.
```

- **(F10) Distributed-lag mapping from contract inflation to real contract price**:

```math
x_t-p_t =
f_1\theta_t + f_2(\theta_t+\theta_{t-1})
+f_3(\theta_t+\theta_{t-1}+\theta_{t-2})
= g(L)\theta_t.
```

- **(F11) Relative-contracting two-sided Phillips curve**:

```math
\pi_t =
f(L)f(L^{-1})
\left[\pi_t+\gamma g^{-1}(L)y_t\right].
```

- **(F12) Nested standard-versus-relative contract index**:

```math
v_t=\sum_{i=0}^{3}f_i\bigl(x_{t-i}-\delta p_{t-i}\bigr),
\qquad 0\leq \delta\leq 1.
```

- **(F13) Nested standard-versus-relative contract equation**:

```math
x_t-\delta p_t =
\sum_{i=0}^{3}f_iE_t\bigl(v_{t+i}+\gamma\tilde y_{t+i}\bigr)
+\epsilon^p_t.
```

The paper reports $`\delta=1`$ as the relative-contracting restriction and $`\delta=0`$ as the standard-contracting restriction. The data fail to reject the relative restriction and reject the standard restriction.

## 4. Market Clearing & Identities

- **(F14) Nominal-output growth identity used in policy experiments**:

```math
\Delta Y_t = \Delta p_t + \Delta y_t.
```

- **(F15) Nominal-output growth reaction function for policy experiments**:

```math
\Delta Y_t =
\alpha_\pi(\pi_t-\bar\pi)+\alpha_y\tilde y_t.
```

- **(F16) Alternative expected-price index for the appendix robustness check**:

```math
\bar p_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_iE_t p_{t+i}.
```

- **(F17) Alternative real contract-price index**:

```math
v_t=\sum_{i=0}^{3}f_i(x_{t-i}-\bar p_{t-i}).
```

- **(F18) Alternative relative contract equation using $`\bar p_t`$**:

```math
x_t-\bar p_t=
\sum_{i=0}^{3}f_iE_t\bigl(v_{t+i}+\gamma\tilde y_{t+i}\bigr)
+\epsilon^p_t.
```

The appendix estimates this alternative but reports that the main $`p_t`$ definition is empirically preferred. These equations are recorded for source coverage; the main `US_FM95AL` archive interpretation is the paper's relative-contracting $`p_t`$ specification.

## 5. Exogenous Processes

- **(F19) Generic linear forward-looking model representation**:

```math
\sum_{i=-\tau}^{0}H_ix_{t+i}
+\sum_{i=1}^{\theta}H_iE_t(x_{t+i})
=\epsilon_t.
```

- **(F20) Future-expectations equation implied by the white-noise shock assumption**:

```math
\sum_{i=-\tau}^{\theta}H_iE_t(x_{t+k+i})=0,\qquad k>0.
```

- **(F21) Saddlepath representation of expectations**:

```math
E_t(x_{t+k})=\sum_{i=-\tau}^{-1}B_iE_t(x_{t+k+i}),\qquad k>0.
```

- **(F22) Observable structural representation after substituting expectations**:

```math
\sum_{i=-\tau}^{0}S_ix_{t+i}=\epsilon_t.
```

- **(F23) Reduced-form output-gap equation used in the local MMB cross-check**:

```math
\tilde y_t = a_0+a_1\tilde y_{t-1}+a_2\tilde y_{t-2}+a_\rho\rho_{t-1}+\epsilon^y_t.
```

- **(F24) Local MMB real-rate / nominal-rate relation cross-check**:

```math
\rho_t-D(\rho_{t+1}-\rho_t)=f_t-\pi_{t+1}.
```

Equations (F23)-(F24) are marked `implementation_cross_check`: they are visible in the local MMB `.mod` file and consistent with the paper's statement that reduced-form equations for the output gap and bill rate are combined with the contracting equations, but the exact coefficient names and auxiliary variables are implementation-side evidence rather than paper-side derivation.

## 6. Steady-State Solution

Because the archive entry is linear / `model(linear)`, steady-state values are normalized to zero for variables expressed as deviations, differences, or inflation relative to baseline:

```math
\bar{\tilde y}=0,\qquad \bar\pi=0,\qquad \bar\theta=0,\qquad \bar\epsilon^p=\bar\epsilon^y=0.
```

For a constant inflation rate $`\bar\pi`$, the source records the steady-state real contract-price gap:

```math
\bar x_t-\bar p_t=\bar\pi\sum_{i=1}^{3}if_i.
```

Under the zero-inflation linearization used in the local MMB implementation, this reduces to:

```math
\bar x-\bar p=0,\qquad \bar v=0.
```

The implementation initializes `ytilde`, `ypsilon`, `infl`, `inflation`, `inflationq`, `output`, and `outputgap` at zero and chooses constants in the interest-rate block to center the auxiliary rate variables. Runtime steady-state validation was not performed.

## 7. Timing & Form Conventions

- **Timing**: contracts negotiated at $`t`$ enter the price index contemporaneously and remain in the weighted index for four quarters through $`x_t,x_{t-1},x_{t-2},x_{t-3}`$.
- **Expectations**: $`E_t(\cdot)`$ conditions on period-$`t`$ history. The contract equation contains expectations through $`t+3`$ in the four-quarter specification.
- **Form**: linear forward-looking system. The MMB implementation uses `model(linear)` and variables such as `p`, `x`, `ytilde`, `infl`, and `rho` as log/rate/gap objects.
- **Stocks**: there are no capital or asset-stock accumulation equations in the paper-side contracting model.
- **Runtime validation**: not performed. Dynare was not run.
- **OCR status**: formulas in the main model block were legible in MinerU Markdown. The exact mapping from the paper's reduced-form VAR coefficients to MMB policy-rule interface variables remains `needs_review` because the local `.mod` comes from MMB implementation conventions and later Fuhrer/Wieland policy-rule usage.
