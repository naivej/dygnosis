# NK_ADE25ppi - Derivation (Optimization Problems + First-Order Conditions)

> Archive status: needs_review. This first-pass derivation is based on the MinerU Markdown of Auray, Devereux, and Eyquem (2025). The paper states that the full two-country equilibrium is given by Online Appendix C equations (C40)-(C48), but that appendix is not available as a normalized Markdown source in this folder. Equations below therefore preserve the paper-side structure and mark appendix-dependent formulas as needs_review.

## 1. Model Overview

- **Model**: two-country New Keynesian open-economy trade-war model with producer-currency pricing, monopolistic competition, Rotemberg price adjustment costs, non-contingent bonds, and discretionary tariff setting.
- **MMB variant**: `NK_ADE25ppi`, the PPI-targeting version. The local MMB implementation cross-check uses producer-price inflation in the monetary-policy feedback variable, unlike `NK_ADE25cpi`, which defines CPI inflation as domestic-goods inflation times the CPI-price-index change.
- **Policy experiment**: non-cooperative tariffs interact with monetary rules. The paper compares PPI targeting, CPI targeting, fixed exchange rates, and more general rules that stabilize tariff-adjusted terms of trade. This archive entry records the PPI-targeting baseline.
- **Agents and policy authorities**: Home and Foreign households consume Home and Foreign goods, supply labor, and hold bonds; monopolistically competitive firms set producer-currency prices; governments choose import tariffs and rebate revenue; central banks set nominal interest rates.
- **Model form**: nonlinear equilibrium conditions solved around a deterministic steady state; the MMB implementation later log-linearizes/simulates, but this derivation keeps nonlinear paper formulas. Runtime validation was not performed.

## 2. Optimization Problems

### 2.1 Home Household

The Home household chooses consumption of Home goods, consumption of Foreign goods, hours, and bond holdings:

```math
\max_{\{C_{h,t},C_{f,t},H_t,B_t\}} E_0\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^t
\left[u(C_{h,t},C_{f,t})-\ell(H_t)\right]
```

subject to the nominal budget constraint

```math
B_t+P_{h,t}C_{h,t}+(1+\tau_t)S_tP_{f,t}^{\ast}C_{f,t}
=R_{t-1}B_{t-1}+W_tH_t+\Pi_t+TR_t .
```

The paper's quantitative model uses aggregate consumption $`C_t`$, labor $`H_t`$ (or $`L_t`$ in the MMB implementation), and a CES price index over domestic and imported goods. The exact Appendix C aggregation is needs_review.

### 2.2 Foreign Household

The Foreign household solves the symmetric problem:

```math
\max_{\{C_{f,t}^{\ast},C_{h,t}^{\ast},H_t^{\ast},B_t^{\ast}\}} E_0\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^t
\left[u^{\ast}(C_{f,t}^{\ast},C_{h,t}^{\ast})-\ell(H_t^{\ast})\right],
```

with the Foreign import tariff $`\tau_t^{\ast}`$ applied to Home goods and with bond denomination following the model variant. The US-China extension changes bond denomination to dollars; this archive entry does not reconstruct that extension as a separate model.

### 2.3 Firms

A continuum of monopolistically competitive Home firms produces differentiated varieties under producer-currency pricing. In the simple model, output of variety $`i`$ is

```math
Y_t(i)=A_tH_t(i).
```

In the full quantitative model, production also uses intermediate goods with share $`\alpha`$:

```math
Y_t=A_tL_t^{1-\alpha}X_t^\alpha,
```

with a symmetric Foreign production function. Firms choose prices subject to demand curves and Rotemberg adjustment costs. The resulting Phillips curves are listed in Section 3.

### 2.4 Governments And Central Banks

The Home and Foreign tariff authorities choose discretionary Nash tariffs. Under flexible exchange rates, the Home problem is summarized in the paper as

```math
\max_{\{C_t,C_t^{\ast},Y_t,Y_t^{\ast},b_t,b_t^{\ast},S_t,\pi_{h,t},\pi_{f,t}^{\ast},\tau_t\}}
V(b_{t-1})=U(C_t,H_t)+\beta E_t[V(b_t)]
```

subject to the full equilibrium constraints and the monetary policy rules. The Foreign problem is symmetric for $`\tau_t^{\ast}`$. These tariff FOCs are not printed in the main text and are therefore needs_review against Online Appendix C.

For `NK_ADE25ppi`, central banks target producer-price inflation rather than CPI inflation.

```

- **(F23) Tariff and monetary shocks used in the MMB implementation cross-check**:

\tau_t^{\ast}=\bar{\tau}^{\ast}+e^{T^{\ast}}_t,\qquad
e^R_t=\rho_R e^R_{t-1}+\varepsilon^R_t,\qquad
e^{R^{\ast}}_t=\rho_{R^{\ast}} e^{R^{\ast}}_{t-1}+\varepsilon^{R^{\ast}}_t.
```

## 6. Steady-State Solution

The deterministic steady state sets shocks to zero and keeps tariffs constant. The paper's calibrated examples use symmetric countries in the baseline Section 5 calibration, while the Section 8 US-China exercise uses asymmetric size, productivity, home bias, and tariff levels.

1. Set $`A=A^{\ast}=1`$ for the symmetric calibration, or use $`A^{\ast}/A=1/3`$ in the US-China application.
2. Set $`\pi_h=\pi_f^{\ast}=1`$ and, under the PPI rule, $`R=R^{\ast}=\beta^{-1}`$ when monetary-policy shocks are zero.
3. Set net foreign assets to the target, commonly $`b=\bar{b}=0`$.
4. Given tariffs $`\tau,\tau^{\ast}`$, compute the CPI/import price indices $`P,P^{\ast},P_x,P_x^{\ast}`$ from (F17)-(F18) and the analogous intermediate-input price indices.
5. Use the steady-state firm conditions to solve marginal costs. With zero inflation and no sales subsidy, the distorted steady state has the monopoly markup distortion; with the first-best subsidy, $`\theta=1`$.
6. Solve labor, intermediate inputs, output, and demands from (F5)-(F16). The full closed-form sequence is needs_review because the main Markdown refers to Appendix C equations (C40)-(C48) rather than printing them.
7. For the simple small-economy PPI case, the paper gives the steady-state optimal tariff:

```math
1+\tau^{ppi}=\frac{\eta}{\eta-1}\frac{1-\theta\Delta_1}{1-\Delta_1},
```

where

```math
\Delta_1=\frac{A^2u_{c_hc_h}}{\ell''(H)}
\left(\theta+\frac{\phi}{\mu_\pi\epsilon}\right)<0.
```

## 7. Timing & Form Conventions

- The derivation is nonlinear. Do not treat these equations as a hand log-linearization.
- Producer-currency pricing is used: sticky prices are in domestic producer prices, so the `ppi` variant targets $`\pi_{h,t}`$ and $`\pi_{f,t}^{\ast}`$.
- CPI inflation differs from PPI inflation by changes in tariff-adjusted terms of trade. For Home, the paper writes

```math
\pi_{cpi,t}=\pi_{h,t}
\frac{\mathcal{P}((1+\tau_t)S_t)}{\mathcal{P}((1+\tau_{t-1})S_{t-1})}.
```

This formula is not the target in `NK_ADE25ppi`, but it identifies the paired CPI variant.
- Bonds/net foreign assets are state variables. The MMB implementation uses lagged net foreign assets and a debt-elastic UIP wedge; exact Appendix C notation is needs_review.
- Tariff policy is discretionary: tariff setters take future policy functions as given when choosing current tariffs.
- Runtime validation was not performed.
