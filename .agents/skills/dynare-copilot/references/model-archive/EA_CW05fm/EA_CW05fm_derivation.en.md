## 1. Model Overview

- **Model ID**: `EA_CW05fm`.
- **Paper**: Coenen and Wieland (2005), "A small estimated euro area model with rational expectations and nominal rigidities", *European Economic Review* 49(5), 1081-1104, DOI `10.1016/j.euroecorev.2003.05.001`.
- **Variant**: the MMB implementation comment identifies `EA_CW05fm` as the relative real wage contracting version associated with Buiter-Jewitt / Fuhrer-Moore. The companion `EA_CW05ta` is the Taylor nominal wage contracting version.
- **Purpose**: a small estimated euro area policy model linking inflation, output gaps, interest rates, and overlapping wage contracts. The paper estimates several contracting specifications and closes the preferred euro-area model with an aggregate demand equation, a Taylor-type policy rule, a term-structure equation, and an ex ante long real rate.
- **Agents/blocks**: wage setters sign overlapping contracts; aggregate demand is a reduced-form IS equation; the central bank sets the short nominal rate; the long nominal and real rates follow expectations/term-structure definitions.
- **Form**: linear rational-expectations model. The Rep-MMB file uses `model(linear)`. Variables are deviations or rates, not levels of a nonlinear DSGE allocation.
- **Source sniff**: first page/first 80 Markdown lines match the expected title and authors, with OCR noise in names and words such as inflation. No title/source mismatch was found.

## 2. Optimization Problems

The paper does not provide micro-founded utility or profit maximization problems. The structural wage-price block is a reduced-form overlapping-contract model. The "choice" object is the newly negotiated contract wage or contract price, conditional on expected prices, real contract wage comparisons, and the output gap.

For the `EA_CW05fm` Fuhrer-Moore relative real wage variant, wage setters choose the current nominal contract wage $`x_t`$ so that the expected real wage over the contract life is tied to expected overlapping real contract wages and the average output gap:

```math
{x_t - E_t[\bar p_t] = E_t\left[\sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i v_{t+i} + \gamma \bar q_t\right] + \sigma_{\varepsilon_x}\varepsilon_{x,t}} \qquad \text{(source M-3)}
```

where the paper defines the contract-life averages

```math
{\bar p_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i p_{t+i}, \qquad \bar q_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i q_{t+i}}
```

and, for the baseline RW case,

```math
{v_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i\left(x_{t-i} - E_t[\bar p_{t-i}]\right)}.
```

The full model is then closed with estimated behavioral equations rather than explicit household, firm, or government optimization problems.

## 3. First-Order Conditions

Because the paper's model is estimated as a linear contracting system, this section records the structural equilibrium conditions that take the place of explicit FOCs. Numbering is continuous across Sections 3-5.

**(F1) Contract weights**

```math
f_i = 0.25 + (1.5-i)s,\qquad i=0,1,2,3,\qquad 0<s\leq \frac{1}{6}.
```

**(F2) Aggregate price index from active contracts**

```math
p_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i x_{t-i}.
```

**(F3) Average expected price over the contract life**

```math
\bar p_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i p_{t+i}.
```

**(F4) Average expected output gap over the contract life**

```math
\bar q_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i q_{t+i}.
```

**(F5) Real contract wage index for the baseline RW specification**

```math
v_t = \sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i\left(x_{t-i} - E_t[\bar p_{t-i}]\right).
```

**(F6) Relative real wage contract equation for `EA_CW05fm`**

```math
x_t - E_t[\bar p_t] = E_t\left[\sum_{i=0}^{3} f_i v_{t+i} + \gamma \bar q_t\right] + \sigma_{\varepsilon_x}\varepsilon_{x,t}.
```

**(F7) Annualized quarterly inflation definition**

```math
\pi_t = p_t - p_{t-1}.
```

`needs_review`: the paper notes that the wage-price block can be rewritten in terms of quarterly inflation and the real contract wage, while the Rep-MMB code uses auxiliary lag/lead variables and a four-quarter inflation measure. The exact algebraic transformation from $`(p_t,x_t)`$ to the implementation's `pi1`, `infl`, and lag variables was cross-checked against the `.mod`, not fully re-derived from the paper.

## 4. Market Clearing & Identities

The model does not include goods, labor, or asset market clearing from a fully micro-founded DSGE allocation. Its closing identities are reduced-form definitions for the output gap, inflation measure, and interest rates.

**(F8) Aggregate demand / IS equation**

```math
q_t = \delta_0 + \delta_1 q_{t-1} + \delta_2 q_{t-2} + \delta_3 r^l_{t-1} + \sigma_{\varepsilon_d}\varepsilon_{d,t}.
```

**(F9) Four-quarter inflation used in the policy rule**

```math
\pi_t^{(4)} = p_t - p_{t-4}.
```

**(F10) Taylor-type short nominal interest-rate rule**

```math
i_t^s = r^{\ast} + \pi_t^{(4)} + \alpha_{\pi}\left(\pi_t^{(4)}-\pi^{\ast}\right) + \alpha_q q_t.
```

**(F11) Long nominal interest rate from expectations hypothesis**

```math
i_t^l = E_t\left[\frac{1}{8}\sum_{j=0}^{7} i_{t+j}^s\right].
```

**(F12) Long ex ante real interest rate**

```math
r_t^l = i_t^l - E_t\left[\frac{1}{2}(p_{t+8}-p_t)\right].
```

**(F13) Deterministic steady-state real-rate relation**

```math
r^{\ast} = -\frac{\delta_0}{\delta_3}.
```

**(F14) Policy target pins down steady-state inflation**

```math
\pi = \pi^{\ast}.
```

`needs_review`: the Rep-MMB implementation uses a smoothed Gerdesmeier-Roffia-style policy rule for `interest`, with `interest = (0.87^3) interest_{t-1} + (1-0.87^3)1.93 inflation + (1-0.87^3)0.28 outputgap + interest_`. This appears to be implementation-specific relative to the paper's Table 4 Taylor rule.

## 5. Exogenous Processes

The paper treats the contract-wage shock and demand shock as serially uncorrelated, zero-mean, unit-variance innovations scaled by standard-deviation parameters.

**(F15) Contract-wage shock**

```math
\varepsilon_{x,t}\sim iid(0,1),\qquad \text{contract block scale } \sigma_{\varepsilon_x}.
```

**(F16) Demand shock**

```math
\varepsilon_{d,t}\sim iid(0,1),\qquad \text{aggregate-demand scale } \sigma_{\varepsilon_d}.
```

**(F17) Monetary policy shock in the Rep-MMB policy rule**

```math
\varepsilon_{i,t}\sim iid(0,\sigma_i^2).
```

`needs_review`: the paper's Table 4 policy rule is deterministic apart from the model simulations, while the Rep-MMB file includes a policy innovation named `interest_`.

## 6. Steady-State Solution

This is a linear model in gaps/rates. The deterministic steady state is characterized by zero output gap and policy-determined inflation.

**(F18) Output-gap steady state**

```math
q = 0.
```

**(F19) Long real-rate steady state**

```math
r^l = r^{\ast} = -\frac{\delta_0}{\delta_3}.
```

**(F20) Inflation steady state**

```math
\pi = \pi^{\ast}.
```

**(F21) Shock steady states**

```math
\varepsilon_x = \varepsilon_d = \varepsilon_i = 0.
```

For a Dynare `model(linear)` implementation, steady states for deviation-style auxiliary variables are zero unless the variable represents a level/rate around a nonzero target that has already been demeaned by the model equations. Runtime steady-state validation was not performed.

## 7. Timing & Form Conventions

- **Contract timing**: four-quarter overlapping contracts. Current aggregate price depends on current and three lagged contract wages; current contract setting depends on expected prices and output gaps over the current and next three quarters.
- **Relative real wage baseline**: `EA_CW05fm` corresponds to the paper's RW case, where the real contract wage index uses expectations conditioned at time $`t`$.
- **Interest-rate timing**: aggregate demand responds to the lagged long ex ante real interest rate $`r^l_{t-1}`$. The long nominal rate averages expected short nominal rates over eight quarters. The long real rate subtracts expected inflation over the following eight quarters.
- **Implementation timing cross-check**: the Rep-MMB file introduces lead/lag auxiliary variables (`ldq1`, `ldq2`, `ldvindex1`, `ldvindex2`, `ldis1`-`ldis6`, `ldpi1`-`ldpi7`) to express forward-looking averages inside `model(linear)`.
- **Form**: linear rational-expectations model, not a nonlinear model to be log-linearized by Dynare.
