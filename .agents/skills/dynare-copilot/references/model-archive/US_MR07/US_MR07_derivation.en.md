## 1. Model Overview

- **Model**: Mankiw and Reis (2007), "Sticky information in general equilibrium.", Journal of the European Economic Association 5(2-3), pp. 603-613, DOI `10.1162/jeea.2007.5.2-3.603`.
- **Core mechanism**: the only rigidity is sticky information. Consumers, workers, and firms update information sporadically before setting consumption, wages, and prices.
- **Agents and blocks**: consumers choose spending, workers choose wages in segmented labor markets, firms set prices under monopolistic competition, production uses labor with decreasing returns, and monetary policy follows a Taylor rule.
- **Form**: log-linear / `model(linear)`. The paper-side Markdown gives five reduced-form equilibrium relations for price level, output, wages, production, and the nominal interest rate. The implementation cross-check approximates the infinite sticky-information sums with 30 lagged expectation terms and uses a long-run output proxy at a 150-quarter lead.
- **Shocks**: aggregate productivity growth, aggregate demand, goods markup, labor markup, and monetary policy shocks.
- **Formula quality**: the main five equations are legible in the MinerU Markdown, but appendix equations and the full algorithmic coefficient definitions are not present in this source. Those omissions are marked `needs_review`.

## 2. Optimization Problems

The article states the underlying microeconomic environment but leaves the detailed optimization problems and equilibrium definition to an appendix available in the working-paper version. The available MinerU Markdown contains only the journal article body, so this section records the source-stated problems at the level supported by the paper and flags missing details.

### Consumers

Households live forever, have additively separable isoelastic utility in consumption and leisure, and trade bonds. A fraction $`\delta`$ of consumers updates information each period and chooses spending using the newly updated information set. The full lifetime problem and bond budget constraint are not printed in the available Markdown source (`needs_review`).

### Workers

Workers supply differentiated labor varieties in segmented markets. Each worker is the sole supplier of a labor variety and sets wages under monopolistic competition. A fraction $`\omega`$ of workers updates information each period. The source-stated wage relation is recorded as (F3); the detailed worker optimization problem is in the unavailable appendix (`needs_review`).

### Firms

Firms sell differentiated goods under monopolistic competition and use a decreasing-returns technology in aggregate labor. A fraction $`\lambda`$ of firms updates information each period before setting prices. The source-stated price-setting relation is recorded as (F1); the detailed firm pricing problem is in the unavailable appendix (`needs_review`).

### Monetary Authority

The central bank follows a Taylor rule. This is a policy rule, not an optimization problem.

## 3. First-Order Conditions

The paper presents the model through five key log-linear equilibrium relations rather than through primitive FOCs. Equations (F1)-(F5) preserve those source-stated reduced forms.

- **(F1) Sticky-information price-setting / aggregate supply relation**:

```math
p_t =
\lambda \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}(1-\lambda)^j E_{t-j}\left[
p_t + \frac{\beta(w_t-p_t)+(1-\beta)y_t-a_t}{\beta+\nu(1-\beta)}
- \frac{\beta v_t}{(\nu-1)[\beta+\nu(1-\beta)]}
\right].
```

Here $`p_t`$ is the price level, $`w_t-p_t`$ is the real wage, $`y_t`$ is output, $`a_t`$ is productivity, $`v_t`$ is the goods-markup shock, $`\nu`$ is the elasticity of substitution across goods, and $`\lambda`$ is the fraction of firms updating information. This equation is source-stated, but it is a reduced-form relation; primitive Calvo-like or sticky-information firm FOCs are `needs_review`.

- **(F2) Sticky-information IS relation**:

```math
y_t =
\delta \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}(1-\delta)^j E_{t-j}\left(y_\infty^n-\theta R_t\right)
+ g_t.
```

The long-run equilibrium output term is

```math
y_\infty^n = \lim_{i\to\infty} E_t[y_{t+i}],
```

and the long real interest rate is source-stated as

```math
R_t = E_t\left[\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(i_{t+i}-\Delta p_{t+1+i})\right].
```

The Markdown OCR around the long-rate notation is imperfect but the economic object is legible (`needs_review` for exact index notation).

- **(F3) Sticky-information wage-setting relation**:

```math
w_t =
\omega \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}(1-\omega)^j E_{t-j}\left[
p_t + \frac{\gamma(w_t-p_t)}{\gamma+\psi}
+ \frac{l_t}{\gamma+\psi}
+ \frac{\psi(y_\infty^n-\theta R_t)}{\theta(\gamma+\psi)}
- \frac{\psi\gamma_t}{(\gamma+\psi)(\gamma-1)}
\right].
```

Here $`w_t`$ is the nominal wage, $`l_t`$ is labor, $`\gamma_t`$ is the labor-markup shock, $`\gamma`$ is the average labor substitutability parameter, $`\psi`$ is the Frisch-elasticity parameter used in the paper, and $`\omega`$ is the fraction of workers updating information.

## 4. Market Clearing & Identities

- **(F4) Production function**:

```math
y_t = a_t + \beta l_t.
```

The parameter $`\beta`$ measures decreasing returns to labor in production. The model has no capital accumulation.

- **(F5) Natural output / output gap definition**:

The Taylor rule uses the output gap $`y_t-y_t^n`$. The source text defines $`y_t^n`$ as the level of output if all agents were attentive, but the closed-form relation used by the `.mod` is from implementation cross-check, not paper-side source:

```math
y_t^n =
\frac{1+1/\psi}{1+1/\psi+\beta/\theta-\beta}a_t
+ \frac{\beta/\theta}{1+1/\psi+\beta/\theta-\beta}g_t
+ \frac{\beta/(\gamma-1)}{1+1/\psi+\beta/\theta-\beta}\gamma_t
+ \frac{\beta/(\nu-1)}{1+1/\psi+\beta/\theta-\beta}v_t.
```

Status: `needs_review`; this expression is consistent with the implementation but is not directly printed in the available Markdown source.

- **(F6) Output gap identity**:

```math
x_t = y_t-y_t^n.
```

- **(F7) Inflation identity**:

```math
\pi_t = p_t-p_{t-1}.
```

## 5. Exogenous Processes

The source states that each shock follows an AR(1) process. The `.mod` cross-check uses productivity in levels with a separate productivity-growth term. The exact appendix-level timing should be checked against the working-paper appendix.

- **(F8) Aggregate demand shock**:

```math
g_t = \rho_g g_{t-1}+e_t^g.
```

- **(F9) Aggregate productivity level and growth shock**:

```math
a_t = (1+\rho_{\Delta a})a_{t-1}-\rho_{\Delta a}a_{t-2}+e_t^{\Delta a},
\qquad
\Delta a_t = a_t-a_{t-1}.
```

Status: `needs_review`; the paper text describes productivity-growth shocks, while the implementation expresses this as a second-order law for the productivity level.

- **(F10) Monetary policy disturbance**:

```math
\varepsilon_t = \rho_\varepsilon \varepsilon_{t-1}+e_t^\varepsilon.
```

- **(F11) Goods-markup shock**:

```math
v_t = \rho_\nu v_{t-1}+e_t^\nu.
```

- **(F12) Labor-markup shock**:

```math
\gamma_t = \rho_\gamma \gamma_{t-1}+e_t^\gamma.
```

- **(F13) Taylor rule**:

```math
i_t = \varphi_y(y_t-y_t^n)+\varphi_p\Delta p_t-\varepsilon_t.
```

The negative sign on the monetary-policy disturbance is source-stated and matches the implementation.

## 6. Steady-State Solution

Because this archive entry is for a log-linear / `model(linear)` representation, steady-state values for endogenous model variables are zero in deviation form:

```math
\bar{x}=\bar{\pi}=\bar{y}=\bar{y}^n=\bar{i}=\bar{l}=\bar{p}=\bar{w}=\bar{R}
=\bar{g}=\bar{a}=\bar{\varepsilon}=\bar{v}=\bar{\gamma}=\overline{\Delta a}=0.
```

The shock innovations also have zero mean:

```math
\bar{e}^g=\bar{e}^{\Delta a}=\bar{e}^{\varepsilon}=\bar{e}^{\nu}=\bar{e}^{\gamma}=0.
```

Finite-lag auxiliary expectation variables used in the implementation, such as $`p_j,w_j,l_j,R_j,y_j`$ for $`j=1,\ldots,30`$, also have zero steady states. Runtime validation was not performed.

## 7. Timing & Form Conventions

- **Linear form**: the model is implemented as `model(linear)`; variables are log deviations or linearized levels around steady state.
- **Information timing**: firms, consumers, and workers that last updated information $`j`$ periods ago use $`E_{t-j}[\cdot]`$ when setting current actions.
- **Finite approximation**: the paper equations use infinite sums over $`j=0,\ldots,\infty`$. The implementation cross-check truncates sticky-information sums at 30 lags and approximates $`y_\infty^n`$ with `y(+150)`.
- **Capital timing**: no capital accumulation appears in the source-stated model.
- **Long real rate**: $`R_t`$ is the expected discounted sum of future ex-ante real short rates; exact index notation in the OCR source is `needs_review`.
- **Runtime validation**: not performed; no Dynare run was executed.
